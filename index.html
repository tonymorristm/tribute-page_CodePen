				<h3>Time Line of Lincoln's Life:</h3>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1809</strong> - Born in a one-room log cabin in Nolin Creek in Kentucky</li>
						<li><strong>1833</strong> - Appointed Postmaster of New Salem, Illinois</li>
						<li><strong>1834</strong> - Elected to the Illinois General Assembly/begins to study law</li>
						<li><strong>1836</strong> - Re-elected to the Illinois General Assembly/leader of the Whig Party</li>
						<li><strong>1836</strong> - Receives his license to practice Law</li>
						<li><strong>1842</strong> - Marries Mary Todd</li>
						<li><strong>1846</strong> - Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives</li>
						<li><strong>1849</strong> - Granted U.S. Patent No. 6,469 (the only President ever granted a patent)</li>
						<li><strong>1858</strong> - He gives his "House Divided" speech at the state convention in Springfield</li>
						<li><strong>1860</strong> - elected as 16th President of the United States (the first Republican)</li>	
						<li><strong>1861</strong> - The Civil War begin</li>
						<li><strong>1863</strong> - Lincoln's Gettysburg Address -</li>
						<blockquote><p>"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

			Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

			But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate - we cannot consecrate - we cannot hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."</p></blockquote>
						<li><strong>1864</strong> - Re-elected as President</li>
						<li><strong>1865</strong> - Closing of his 2nd Inaugral speech -</li>
						<blockquote><p>..."Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."

			With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."</p></blockquote>
						<li><strong>1865</strong> - Assasinated at Ford's Theatre</li>
